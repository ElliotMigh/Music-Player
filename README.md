# Music-Player
Well, hello, the application you are viewing is a simple music player that was one of my exercises. This application plays the desired song using the media player. You can also use the available buttons to pause the song or play it for 15 seconds. Fast forward or rewind and you also have the ability to mute the song
In this project, I used two libraries, the first one is used to round the cover photo and the second one is used for clicking the like button, which has an attractive animation.
